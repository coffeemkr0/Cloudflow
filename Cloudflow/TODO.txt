Use the Task library to manage Runs so that they are on separate threads that can be limited, monitored and stopped

Let the agent handle a queue of Runs from all of its jobs
	Stopping the agent should wait for any runs that have been started to finish and it should clear any that have not started

Allow a list of triggers instead of a single trigger per job
Make ports configurable and/or dynamic.
Make it so that runs have a configurable name format that is generated when the run starts (similar to Tfs builds)

Triggers starting other triggers:
	For example, a trigger that watches for folders being created in a watch folder
	This trigger being fired Starts another trigger that watches for files that are created in the new folder
	This file watcher trigger getting fired starts a run
	This sounds like having dynamically created triggers

Trigger examples:
	Watch folder
	Monitor an email account
	A WCF or SignalR service that listens for Http requests
	Poll a database
	Fire an event from Sql Server that fires the trigger (not polling)

	

start making methods extensible




Authenitcaiton - create a user account and only access "my stuff"
Ability to add, edit and remove Agents
Download the job and an agent to a "worker PC"
Start the job from the web page
Monitor progress from the web page to know when the work is done



Ability to setup "jobs" - Jobs being the settings that are required for the agent to know what to do:
	1. Input folder that contains the jpegs
	2. Output folder to place the pdfs
