Create a Run class that represents what happens when a trigger is fired
	Runs should be on their own thread and have their own logger

Make ports configurable and/or dynamic.

Triggers starting other triggers:
	For example, a trigger that watches for folders being created in a watch folder
	This trigger being fired Starts another trigger that watches for files that are created in the new folder
	This file watcher trigger getting fired starts a run
	This sounds like having dynamically created triggers

Trigger examples:
	Watch folder
	Monitor an email account
	A WCF or SignalR service that listens for Http requests
	Poll a database
	Fire an event from Sql Server that fires the trigger (not polling)
